**RL-Kernel** is a high-performance, memory-efficient infrastructure for Reinforcement Learning post-training. It eliminates the memory and latency bottlenecks in Large Language Model alignment, This project targets AI infrastructure engineers, algorithm researchers, and enterprise-level large model alignment scenarios, providing specialized kernels for algorithms like **GRPO**, **PPO**, and **DPO**.

## Performance Benchmarks: Breaking the Memory Wall

RL-Kernel is designed to solve the $O(G \cdot L \cdot V)$ memory explosion in DeepSeek-style **GRPO** training. A typical scenario is as follows:

### 1. Logprob Computation (Training Stability)
By implementing **Pre-allocated Chunking**, RL-Kernel maintains constant additional VRAM overhead regardless of the group size ($G$).

**Testbed**: NVIDIA A100 80GB | **Model**: Llama-3-8B | **Vocab**: 128,256 | **SeqLen**: 512
| Group Size ($G$) | TRL (Standard) | PyTorch Native | **RL-Kernel (Ours)** | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **G = 64** | OOM | 15.66 GB | **16.15 GB** | Success |
| **G = 128** | OOM | 31.31 GB | **31.80 GB** | Success |
| **G = 256** | **FAILED (OOM)** | 62.63 GB | **63.12 GB** | **Optimized** |

*Note: RL-Kernel is the only solution that successfully scales G=256 on a single A100 by keeping extra VRAM usage to a constant ~0.5GB.*

### 2. Sampling Latency (Rollout Speed)
Integrating **FlashInfer** fused kernels to accelerate the bottleneck of RL training: the sampling phase.

| Batch Size ($G$) | Native PyTorch | **RL-Kernel (Fused)** | **Speedup** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 32 | 176.79 ms | **1.08 ms** | **163x** |
| 64 | 10.54 ms | **1.31 ms** | **8x** |
| 128 | 18.89 ms | **1.86 ms** | **10x** |
| 256 | 36.23 ms | **2.94 ms** | **12x** |

### 3. Real Model Validation (Qwen3-30B-A3B MoE)

**Testbed**: NVIDIA A100 80GB | **Model**: Qwen3-30B-A3B | **Vocab**: 151,936 | **dtype**: fp16

Model weights consume 56.9 GB — only 23 GB headroom remaining for training computation.

## Key Features

- **Zero-Growth Memory Pool**: Uses pre-allocated buffers and micro-chunking to prevent VRAM spikes during advantage calculation.
- **Fused Sampling Pipeline**: Direct integration with **FlashInfer** and **vLLM** backends for sub-2ms sampling latency.
- **Universal Backend Abstraction**: Unified API supporting both **NVIDIA (CUDA/FlashInfer)** and **AMD (ROCm/AITER)**.
- **Post-Training Ready**: Drop-in replacement for standard sampling and logprob operators in TRL or DeepSpeed-Chat.

## Acknowledgments

RL-Kernel builds on the shoulders of excellent open-source projects:

- **[FlashInfer](https://github.com/flashinfer-ai/flashinfer)** — We integrate FlashInfer's fused sampling kernels as the NVIDIA backend for our sampling pipeline. The sub-2ms sampling latency results are enabled by FlashInfer's highly optimized CUDA operators.
- **[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)** — Inspired by vLLM's kernel design philosophy and hardware-aware scheduling approach.
- **[DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)** — Inspired by DeepSpeed's approach to memory-efficient training infrastructure.

We are grateful to these teams for their contributions to the open-source AI infrastructure ecosystem.
